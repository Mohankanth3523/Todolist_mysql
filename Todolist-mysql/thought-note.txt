Todolist with Mysql
 

Front-end:
The React.js front-end efficiently manages the user interface and state through components.
The key components include App.js, responsible for rendering the task list and handling user input, and TaskItem.js, used for rendering individual tasks.

Back-end:
The Node.js/Express.js back-end handles HTTP requests and interacts with the MySQL database.
It provides two key endpoints: GET /api/tasks for fetching tasks and POST /api/tasks for adding new tasks.

Database:
The MySQL database stores task data in a "tasks" table with columns for task ID and task description.

API Communication:
Axios is used in the front-end to make asynchronous API requests to the back-end.
